# unit-4-game

This app dynamically updates the HTML pages with the jQuery library.


This is a medieval themed, number matching game.

Here's how the game works: 

You will be given a random number at the start of the game, or "your troops". There are four symbols below. By clicking on a symbol you will add a specific number or amount to the "enemy troops". 

You get wins in the game by matching the enemy troops to your troops. You get losses in the game if the enemy troops exceed your troops. 

The value of each symbol is hidden from you until you click on it. Each time when the game starts, the game will change the values of each symbol.
